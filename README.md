# Algorithm Calculator

This project is a web-based application that simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms. It provides an interactive interface for users to input process details and view calculated results, including execution order and average times.

## Features
- **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)**: Executes processes in the order they arrive.
- **SJF (Shortest Job First)**: Prioritizes processes with the shortest burst time.
- **RR (Round Robin)**: Uses time slicing for fair CPU allocation.
- **SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)**: A preemptive version of SJF.
- **HRRN (Highest Response Ratio Next)**: Balances priority using response ratio.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js** – React-based framework for SSR and routing.
- **TypeScript** – Ensures type safety and better development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Provides a clean and responsive UI.
